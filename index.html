            World Environment Day is marked every year on June 5. Inaugurated by the United Nations General Assembly in 1972, it is a date that aims to invigorate people globally to act towards protecting and restoring our planet. This a crucial initiative, given that almost half of the world’s children live in areas of high climate and environmental hazard. It is also a pressing goal for anyone who cares about future generations, as 84% of youths in the Philippines are worried about climate change, with 70% concerned about climate action - or more specifically, inaction, by people with the most power to make a difference; governments and business owners.   
            <br>
            <br>
            This year's World Environment Day theme is about tackling Plastic Pollution. The first synthetic plastic, Bakelite, was patented in 1907, just over 100 years ago. The new material was wondrous because of its specific chemical properties of durability, malleability, and ease of production. These capabilities caused its production to skyrocket, and also are causing the planet’s downfall. 
            <br>
            <br>
            In general, plastics take around thousands to hundreds of thousands of years to degrade. This longevity causes issues in our ecosystems, most prominently observed in the bioaccumulation of plastics through the food chain, ending up in our plates. As if eating plastic is not bad enough, the degradation products of plastic cause potent health issues, showing negative effects to be multi-layered. Microplastics have invaded all areas of the planet, from fields to rainforests to rivers. Having been around for so long, some microorganisms in the sea have adapted to live and proliferate in man-made plastics - the ‘plastisphere’ in the sea. Perhaps most alarmingly, microplastics enter the human body through the air we breathe, depositing in our lungs, kidney, and spleen. This process starts within the first few moments of life, affecting children in every country. Scientific consensus shows that this is bad for human health. Sick children grow to be sicker adults, and unwell populations lead to an ill environment which decreases the vitality of the planet.
            <br>
            <br>
            Plastic pollution also contributes to the grander scheme of the climate crisis. Everybody on this planet should be concerned about this issue because the climate crisis is a child rights crisis. Plastic pollution exemplifies this with its reverberating impacts on the Convention on the Rights of the Child, by preventing children’s access to their rights of life, survival, and development, standard of living and leisure, play, and culture. 
            <br>
            <br>
            As mentioned above, microplastic invade many body cavities, which impairs the body’s ability to function optimally. For instance, exposure to microplastics amongst other pollutants exacerbates asthma symptoms in children, and can even quicken the onset of asthma leading to a poorer quality of life. Some evidence even suggests that maternal exposure to microplastic can cause miscarriage, increase the chance of post-natal mortality, and contributes to developing diseases in later life such as obesity, hypertension, and cancer.
            <br>
            <br>
            Reducing microplastics in the environment, hence exposure to all children can improve access to survival and development. Similarly, plastics decrease the standard of living not just through health outcomes, but also by decreasing biodiversity and even the potential for economic growth. Not only does plastic pollution decrease the livability of our planet for the next generations, but it also insidiously intertwines itself with children’s lives by being a component of children’s toys. When outgrown these toys cannot be broken down safely, and disrupt delicate balances on Earth, tearing down fundamental human rights like sustainable food and water access and safe housing. With a struggle for meeting a child’s basic needs for survival, play, leisure, and cultural activities will inadvertently take a backseat. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Preventing these disastrous outcomes by curbing plastic pollution can be achieved with support from governments to pledge an end to all single-use plastic and tangible action on commitments by the plastic industry. It is important to note that there is scope for careers to be harnessed through this objective, as every problem requires creative thinking for solutions. Governments can fund innovations such as making 100% plastic bricks out of recycled plastic collected from shores, as is being done in 2023’s World Environment Day host country Cote d'Ivoire. Individually, we can urge the people with the power to make a difference to make the right choices. Whilst persuasion goes on, we can all make personal efforts to clean up and prevent plastic waste by actions such as participating in river and beach cleans, adopting a zero-waste lifestyle, and shopping sustainably. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Yet it is important to remember that plastic is not the villain here. The boom in plastic production all those years ago and the same reason it is continuously being produced today is because it is endlessly useful, and has allowed human activity to progress. Plastic provided equal access to amenities such as phones and housing across the globe and even made education more accessible through forming electronics or providing easily transportable food. The goal is not to ban all plastic; it is to find methods that integrate plastic sustainably into society to feed into a circular economy.
